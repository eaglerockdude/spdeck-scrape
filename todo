# to do's: 
    # make CLI to ask for queries
        # add a display option (or a heavy display and a light display)
    # collect data to present an "estimated time to complete scrape (bandwidth dependent)" after entering a query
    # gemify
        # write tests
    # dump into database
    # I don't understand how I'm grabbing the first page of query results, but I am.... figure this out
    # add a database?
    # put it up on a website
    # grab dates
    # interactive query?
    # size the title/author display based on log(views)

    # implement a defense against a query that doesn't return enough results for the range
    # stats and comparisons of views for different queries (implement something that learns about common queries...? pretty advanced)

# is there a way to track bandwidth used in nokogiri calls?
